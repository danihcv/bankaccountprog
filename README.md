# Bank Account Simple Program

This is a program to make a similar bank account where a user can deposit, withdraw, and transfer money. 
 
We will be using java with some sql. The sql implemantation will be later on the process. 
To start out simple, we will first have 3 functions that will make simple transactions.  

1. The main function where code will run.
2. A deposit function
3. A withdraw function  

The login function will be in the main function for the moment using only one user for testing.
